# University of Code

This is a collection of questions from the University of Code daily coding challenge. It is intended to be few months later than the most updated challenge.

I have attached my solution to each challenge. There are always more than one way to solve a problem, so please try them on your own if you have a different solution on your mind.

To get the latest challenge, please visit https://www.papareact.com/universityofcode and subscribe.

I suggest using https://leetcode.com/playground to do the challenge. But of course you can do it in Visual Studio Code if you know how to set it up.
