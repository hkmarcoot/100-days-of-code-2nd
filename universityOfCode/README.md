# University of Code

This is a collection of questions from the University of Code daily coding challenge. It is intended to be few months later than the most updated challenge.

I have attached my solution to each challenge. There are always more than one way to solve a problem, so please try them on your own if you have a different solution on your mind.

To get the latest challenge, please visit https://www.papareact.com/universityofcode and subscribe.

I suggest using https://leetcode.com/playground to do the challenge. Nonetheless, you can use this template created by UOC and run 'npm run test' in terminal to have the Jest testing - https://stackblitz.com/edit/papafam-coding-challenges-testing-starter-project?file=functions.test.js&view=editor . Here is the video from Sonny to setup the test - https://youtu.be/1BLv_eXyMTM?si=CDDhIytmT8r20JFN
