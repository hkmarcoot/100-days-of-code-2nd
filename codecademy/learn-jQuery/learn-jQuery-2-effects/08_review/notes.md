Review: Effects
Wow! Youâ€™ve completed this table of 9 different jQuery effects. Great job! To review, the methods that we learned were:

.hide()
.show()
.toggle()

These methods instantly hide or show elements on a web page.

.fadeOut()
.fadeIn()
.fadeToggle()

These methods make elements disappear or appear over a given period of time.

.slideUp()
.slideDown()
.slideToggle()

These methods make elements slide up or down into place over a given period of time.

Using these effects, you can make your web pages eye-catching and dynamic. And thanks to the magic of jQuery all of this can be done with very few lines of code!
