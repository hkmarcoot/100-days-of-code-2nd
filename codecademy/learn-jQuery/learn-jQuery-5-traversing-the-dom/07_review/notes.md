## Review: Traversing the DOM

Understanding how elements relate to each other in the DOM makes it easy to efficiently select elements. We have covered several methods in this lesson including:

- .children() to target an element’s child elements.
- .siblings() to target elements adjacent to an element.
- .parent() to target an element’s parent.
- .closest() travels up the DOM tree from the current element to target the closest element with a given selector.
- .next() to target the element immediately following the selected element.
- .prev() to target the element that is immediately preceding the selected element.
- .find() to target descendant elements by some selector, ie- class, id, tag etc.

In addition to these methods, there are even more, including .prevUntil(), .nextUntil() and others. To get an idea, check out Mozilla Developer Network reference for jQuery Traversing.
