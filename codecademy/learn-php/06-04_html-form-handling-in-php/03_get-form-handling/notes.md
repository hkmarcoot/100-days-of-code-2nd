## GET Form Handling

In HTML, setting a form’s method attribute to "get" specifies that you would like the form to be submitted using the GET method. When using this method, the form entries are passed as parameters in a URL query string.

For example, this is a request to www.codecademy.com with the URL parameters first (set to the value "ellen") and last (set to the value "richards"):

```
www.codecademy.com/?first=ellen&last=richards

```

The parameter names (first and last) come from the name attribute of each form input.

For example, the following form could be used to collect an individual’s name using the GET method:

```
<form method="get">
First name: <input type="text" name="first">
<br>
Last name: <input type="text" name="last">
<br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Name">
</form>

```

When the form is submitted, the form data is available in the $\_GET superglobal array. The data is also accessible using $\_REQUEST if you do not care about which method was used by the client.

In our example, if a user typed “ellen” into the first input and “richards” into the last input, then print_r($\_GET) would look like this:

```
Array ( [first] => ellen [last] => richards )

```

To echo the value of the first input, we pass the parameter name to the $\_GET array like below:

```
<?=$_GET['first'];?>

```
