## What is the Front-End?

Let’s talk about the difference between a front-end language and a back-end language. HTML is a front-end language, but what exactly does that mean?

When navigating to a website from our web browser, the browser makes a request for content on our behalf. What we see and experience as a single website is actually composed of a number of files which come together to form a cohesive experience.

The files we receive consist of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and other static assets. A static asset is a file that doesn’t change. When we navigate to a webpage, these assets are sent to a browser.

You may have heard front-end development referred to as client-side development. In web development, we are typically referring to the browser as the client. A human may be experiencing the website, but it’s the browser that makes requests for information and receives the responses.

The front-end of a website or web application consists of all the elements of the website that are sent to the client upon request. But something has to be listening for those requests and deciding what to send — it’s the back-end of the website that does all that and more.
