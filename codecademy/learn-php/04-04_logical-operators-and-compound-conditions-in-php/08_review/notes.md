Great job! You’ve learned the tools needed to craft programs with powerful decision making capabilities. Let’s review what we covered:

- By nesting conditionals within one another, we can create branching decisions.
- The logical operator || takes two different boolean values or expressions as its operands and returns a single boolean value. It returns TRUE if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to TRUE.
- The logical && operator returns TRUE only if both of its operands evaluate to TRUE. It returns FALSE if either or both of its operands evaluate to FALSE.
- The logical not operator (!) takes only a right operand. It reverses the boolean value of its operand.
- The logical exclusive or operator (xor) returns TRUE only if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to TRUE, but not both or neither.
- PHP includes alternate syntax for the || and && operators: we can use or in place of ||, and we can use and in place of &&. These operators work much the same way but have different operator precedence.
- We can include code from one file inside another with include which allows us to write mode modular programs.
