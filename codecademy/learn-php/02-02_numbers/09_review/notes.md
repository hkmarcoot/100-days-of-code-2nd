Great job! In this lesson, we learned all about using numbers in PHP. Letâ€™s review what we covered:

- PHP has two number data types: integers and floating point numbers
- We can use arithmetic operators for performing math operations:

- Operations have an order of precedence meaning that certain types of operations in a chain will be evaluated before others: first evaluated will be any operation wrapped in parenthesis (()), next exponents (\*_), then multiplication (_) and division (/), and finally addition (+) and subtraction (-). The acronym PEMDAS can be a helpful way of remembering the order.
- We can assign number values to variables and then perform numerical operations with them.
- We can use mathematical assignment operators as a shorthand when reassigning number variables:
