Why Use Shorthand?

Using the traditional loop syntax in PHP with brackets ({}) to open and close code blocks can be used when embedding PHP code in HTML:

```
<ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 2; $i++) {
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
}
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>

```

However, when adding nested loops, the readability of the code can suffer. To determine where loops end, we have to count and match brackets.

Luckily, PHP offers an alternate syntax which is especially useful when working with HTML. Instead of using an opening bracket ({), we use a colon (:) and instead of using a closing bracket (}), we use a closing keyword and semicolon (;). For the for loop, the closing keyword is endfor. Our duck, duck, goose example becomes:

```
<ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 2; $i++):
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
endfor;
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>

```

Now, when reading this code, it becomes immediately apparent that the endfor keyword is closing the for loop.
