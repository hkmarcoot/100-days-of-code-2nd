Loop Shorthand
Weâ€™ve already covered the shorthand for for loops in PHP. The versions for while and foreach loops are very similar.

The only difference is the closing keywords. For a while loop, the closing keyword is endwhile, and for the foreach loop, the closing keyword is endforeach.

Our duck, duck, goose example for the while loop becomes:

```
<ul>
<?php
$i = 0;
while ($i < 2):
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
$i++;
endwhile;
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>

```

And the same example using foreach becomes:

```
<ul>
<?php
$array = [0, 1];
foreach ($array as $i):
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
endforeach;
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>

```
