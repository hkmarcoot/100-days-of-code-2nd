## Bootstrap Breakpoints

One benefit of using Bootstrap is that it incorporates responsive design. With responsive design, the layout of the content changes to accommodate a userâ€™s screen size.

Bootstrap categorizes screen sizes into 5 categories or as breakpoints: extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large. Each breakpoint has a range measured in pixels. The range of these breakpoints and accompanying device types are marked in the following table:

| Category    | Breakpoint Range | Device Type           |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Extra small | < 576px          | portrait smartphones  |
| Small       | >= 576px         | landscape smartphones |
| Medium      | >= 768px         | tablets               |
| Large       | >= 992px         | desktops              |
| Extra Large | >= 1200px        | large desktop         |
