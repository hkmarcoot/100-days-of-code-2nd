Because we checked documentation we were able to use:

- animations and interactivity that requires the addition of Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript files.
- utility classes which affect the styling and position of elements.
- the nav component provides default Bootstrap styling to links.
- the responsive navbar component to quickly navigate between webpages.
- the jumbotron component which prominently displays an image or text.
- the card component that acts as a stylized content container.
- collapse to toggle component visibility.
- the carousel component to create a slideshow which displays images or text.
