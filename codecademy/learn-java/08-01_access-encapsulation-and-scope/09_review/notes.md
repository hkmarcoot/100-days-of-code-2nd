Here are some of the main takeaways from this lesson:

- The public and private keywords are used to define what parts of code have access to other classes, methods, constructors, and instance variables.
- Encapsulation is a technique used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes. Its aim is to create small bundles of logic.
- The this keyword can be used to designate the difference between instance variables and local variables.
- Local variables can only be used within the scope that they were defined in.
- The this keyword can be used to call methods when writing classes.
