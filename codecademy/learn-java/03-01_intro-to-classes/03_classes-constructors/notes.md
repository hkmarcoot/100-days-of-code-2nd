## Classes: Constructors

In Java, the constructor is a special type of method defined within the class, used to initialize fields when an instance of the class is created. The name of the constructor method must be the same as the class itself. Generally, the constructor is defined as public. Again, don’t worry about the meaning of the public keyword for now. We will discuss this in a later exercise.

Let’s look at an updated Car class, which includes a constructor.

```
public class Car {

 // Constructor
 public Car() {

   // instructions for creating a Car instance
 }
}

```

In the following example, the Car instance is assigned to the variable ferrari:

```
Car ferrari = new Car();

```

In this example, we have created an instance of a Car class called ferrari.

After the assignment operator, (=), we call the constructor method, Car(), using the keyword new to indicate that we’re creating a new instance of the Car class. Omitting the new keyword causes an error.

If we print the value of the variable ferrari we would see its memory address: Car@76ed5528 In the above example, our variable ferrari is declared as a reference data type rather than with a primitive data type like int or boolean. This means that the variable holds a reference to the memory address of an instance. During its declaration, we specify the class name as the variable’s type, which in this case is Car.

If we use a special value, null, we can initialize a reference-type variable without giving it a reference. If we were to assign null to an object, it would have a void reference because null has no value.

For example, consider the following code snippet where we create an instance of a Car, assign it a reference, and then set its value to null:

```
Car thunderBird = new Car();

System.out.println(thunderBird); // Prints: Car@76ed5528

thunderBird = null; // change value to null

System.out.println(thunderBird); // Prints: null

```

It’s important to understand that using a null reference to call a method or access an instance variable will result in a NullPointerException error.
