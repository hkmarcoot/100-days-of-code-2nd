## Classes: Syntax

Let’s explore how to define a class in Java. We will use a class called Car that represents a real-world car.

The Car class in Java is defined like so:

```
public class Car {
  // Empty Java Class
}

```

In this example, a class named Car is defined with the public keyword. We’ll discuss what the keyword public means in a later exercise. Inside the body of the class, we can add fields to represent relevant information and functions to represent how this class can interact with other objects. We will fill out this class in later exercises.

Let’s practice creating classes by creating a class to represent a store.
