## Static Methods Refresher

In this lesson, we’re going to dive into how to create classes with your own static methods and static variables. To begin, let’s take a quick refresher on static methods.

Static methods are methods that belong to an entire class, not a specific object of the class. Static methods are called using the class name and the . operator. We’ve seen a couple of static methods already!

```
double randomNumber = Math.random();
// Stores a random decimal between 0.0 and 1.0 in randomNumber

double number = Double.valueOf("2.5");
// Transforms the String "2.5" into a double

```

In the first example, random() is a static method that belongs to the Math class. We didn’t need to create a Math object (like Math myMathObject = new Math()) in order to use that method. We could just call it using the class name.

Similarly, valueOf() is a static method of the Double class. Given a String as an input, this method will turn that String into a double. Again, we don’t need to create a Double object in order to call this method — we use the class itself to call it.

Finally, notice that our main() methods have been static this whole time. When Java runs your program, it calls that the main method of your class — YourClassName.main().
