In this lesson, we’ve started writing our first programs in Java.

We’ve also learned rules and guidelines for how to write Java programs:

- Java programs have at least one class and one main() method.
  - Each class represents one real-world idea.
  - The main() method runs the tasks of the program.
- Java comments add helpful context to human readers.
- Java has whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons.
  - Whitespace is for humans to read code easily.
  - Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method.
  - Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
- Java is a compiled language.
  - Compiling catches mistakes in our code.
  - Compilers transform code into an executable class.
