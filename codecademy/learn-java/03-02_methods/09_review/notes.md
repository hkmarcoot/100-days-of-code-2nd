Let’s review everything we have learned about methods so far.

- Defining a method : Method declarations will declare a method’s return type, name, and parameters
- Calling a method : Methods are invoked with a . and ()
- Parameters : Inputs to the method and their types are declared in parentheses in the method signature
- Changing Instance Fields : Methods can be used to change the value of an instance field
- Scope : Variables only exist within the domain that they are created in
- Return : The type of the variables that will be output are declared in the method declaration
