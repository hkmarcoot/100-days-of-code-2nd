## Working with Lists

Now that we know how to create and access list data, we can start to explore additional ways of working with lists.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Add and remove items from a list using a specific index.
- Create lists with continuous values.
- Get the length of a list.
- Select portions of a list (called slicing).
- Count the number of times that an element appears in a list.
- Sort a list of items.
