In Python, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but here are some common ones:

- SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
- NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown.
- TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
