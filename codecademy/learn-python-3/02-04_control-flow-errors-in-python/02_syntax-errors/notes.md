SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written â€” punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

Some common syntax errors are:

Misspelling a Python keyword.
Missing colon :.
Missing closing parenthesis ), square bracket ], or curly brace }.
