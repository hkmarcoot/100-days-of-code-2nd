A TypeError is reported by the Python interpreter when an operation is applied to a variable of an inappropriate type.

This can occur in Python when one attempts to use an operator on something of the incorrect type.

Some common type errors are:

Accidentally adding or subtracting a string value.
Call a function on something of the incorrect type.
