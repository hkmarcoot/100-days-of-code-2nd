So far we’ve covered what a data type actually is in Python. We explored what the functionality of Python’s built-in types (also referred to as primitives) are. We learned how to create our own data types using the class keyword.

We explored the relationship between a class and an object — we create objects when we instantiate a class, we find the class when we check the type() of an object. We learned the difference between class variables (the same for all objects of a class) and instance variables (unique for each object).
