Great work! I hope you are now starting to see the potential of strings and how they can be used to solve a huge variety of problems.

In this lesson you learned:

- A string is a list of characters.
- A character can be selected from a string using its index string_name[index]. These indices start at 0.
- A ‘slice’ can be selected from a string. These can be between two indices or can be open-ended, selecting all of the string from a point.
- Strings can be concatenated to make larger strings.
- len() can be used to determine the number of characters in a string.
- Strings can be iterated through using for loops.
- Iterating through strings opens up a huge potential for applications, especially when combined with conditional statements.
