Excellent work! üëè In this lesson, you‚Äôve covered a major fundamental programming concept used in the majority of all programs to organize code into reusable blocks. To recap, we explored:

- What problems arise in our programs without functions
- What functions are and how to write them
- How whitespace plays an important role in how a program will execute our code and more importantly distinguish function code from non-function code
- How to pass input values into our functions using parameters and arguments
- The difference between built-in and user-defined functions and some common built-in functions python offers
- How we can reuse function output with the return keyword, as well as multiple returns.
- Where variables can be accessed in our programs that use functions
