Review
Great job! We covered a ton of material in this lesson and we’ve increased the number of tools in our Python toolkit by several-fold. Let’s review what we’ve learned this lesson:

- Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False
- A boolean variable is a variable that is set to either True or False.
- We can create boolean expressions using relational operators:
  - ==: Equals
  - !=: Not equals
  - > : Greater than
  - > =: Greater than or equal to
  - <: Less than
  - <=: Less than or equal to
- if statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
- else statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.
- elif statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements
