You just learned about numerical data types and how to work with numerical data in a few different ways:

- Use arithmetic operators to write expressions.
- Combine operators together to write more concise programs.
- Use the modulo operator (%) to find remainders.
- Use built-in methods to do more complex math.
- Use documentation to look new things up.
