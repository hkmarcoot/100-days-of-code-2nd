## Introduction to References

What do you think will be printed by this code?

```
Encyclopedia enc1 = new Encyclopedia();
Encyclopedia enc2 = enc1;
enc1.CurrentPage = 0;
enc2.CurrentPage = 16;
Console.WriteLine(enc1.CurrentPage);
Console.WriteLine(enc2.CurrentPage);

```

The answer is 16 and 16.

To understand whatâ€™s happening here, we must understand references. References are going to change the way we can modify and store values. This lesson will explore how references work in C# and how they are useful.
