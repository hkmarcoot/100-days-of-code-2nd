In this lesson, we learned that:

- Classes and interfaces are reference types. A variable of this type holds a reference to the data, not the data itself. This is different from value types like int and bool.
- The equality operator (==) uses a referential comparison for reference types and a value comparison for value types.
- Multiple references can be created for a single object.
- A reference and its corresponding object do not have to be the same type. For example, we can refer to a subclass object by an inherited superclass or implemented interface reference.
- The functionality available to an object reference is determined by the reference’s type, not the object’s type.
