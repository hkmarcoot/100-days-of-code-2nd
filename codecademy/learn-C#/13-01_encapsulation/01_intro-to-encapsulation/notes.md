## Introduction to Encapsulation

So far, we’ve learned that classes can be a useful tool in the process of abstraction, or pulling related pieces of information and behavior into logical, reusable chunks. Classes act as blueprints that we can use to make multiple similar objects, also called “instances” of the class.

When we write programs that utilize classes and objects, it is often referred to as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Some languages, such as C#, heavily engrain the use of classes — you may have noticed that most of the programs we’ve written so far have included a class, Program, which holds the definition of the Main() method.

Abstraction is the first of 4 key tenets of OOP, which are often referred to as the “pillars” of object-oriented programming. The 4 pillars are:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Next, we’ll learn about encapsulation. In programming, we often need to control how parts of our program can be accessed and modified, whether it’s to hide sensitive data, ensure that age is always set to a positive integer, or to obscure complex implementation details. The process of hiding grouped data behind a barrier (such as a class definition) and dictating how the data can be accessed and modified is known as encapsulation.

In this lesson, we will cover the following techniques that C# provides for implementing encapsulation:

- control access to class members using public and private
- control access to fields using properties and automatic properties
- attach members to a class itself, instead of to its instances, using static
- create and use static classes
