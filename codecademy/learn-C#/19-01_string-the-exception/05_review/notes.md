Here’s what was covered in this lesson:

- The String or string type is a reference type.
- Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created.
- Being immutable also means that a string reference will always point to the original object, so “modifying” one reference to a string will not affect other references to it.
- With the equality operator (==), strings are checked for value, not referential equality.
- A string variable can be unassigned, null, or empty. Empty strings can be represented by String.Empty or "" — they’re equivalent.
