In this lesson, we learned:

- A list, or List<T>, is a generic, sequential data structure. The specific type that it contains is specified upon instantiation.
- Lists are effectively unlimited.
- List values can be accessed by index using square brackets: [ ].
- To create an empty list, use a basic constructor. To create a list with values, use object initialization.
- Add() adds an element to a list.
- Remove() removes an element from the list. It returns true if it is successful and false otherwise.
- Count is the number of elements in the array.
- Contains() returns true if the argument exists in the list, false otherwise.
- A sequence within a list is called a range. There are specific methods for working with ranges, including GetRange(), AddRange(), InsertRange(), and RemoveRange().
- Lists are a type of generic collection, defined with generic type parameters. The type parameters are specified when instantiating any generic class.
- Use lists and dictionaries in your code by including this line at the top of your file:

```
using System.Collections.Generic;

```
