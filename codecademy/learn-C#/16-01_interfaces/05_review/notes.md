In this lesson, we:

- learned that interfaces are useful to guarantee certain functionality across multiple classes
- built an interface using the interface keyword
- defined properties and methods (but not constructors or fields) in the interface
- built classes that implemented the interface
- inherit from a base class and implement one or more interfaces
