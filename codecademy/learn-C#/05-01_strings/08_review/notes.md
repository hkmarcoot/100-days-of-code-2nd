You just learned about how to work with textual data in a few different ways:

- How to save char and string values to a variable.
- Use the addition symbol (+) to concatenate strings.
- Interpolate strings for easier string construction.
- Find information about a string using .Length and .IndexOf().
- Grab characters and parts of strings using bracket notation and .Substring().
- Use built-in methods such as .ToUpper() and .ToLower() to manipulate strings.
