## Create a Superclass

A superclass is defined just like any other class:

```
class Vehicle
{
}

```

And a subclass inherits, or “extends”, a superclass using the colon syntax:

```
class Sedan : Vehicle
{
}

```

The above code means that Sedan will inherit all the functionality of the Vehicle class.
