Hereâ€™s what we covered:

- Methods can be called by adding parentheses to the end of the method name.
- Every time an application is started, the Main() method is called.
- Methods can return values as output. Method outputs can be stored in variables for later use.
- A basic method can be defined using the following syntax:

```
static void BasicMethod()
{
  // method implementation
}

```

- Arguments are values passed to a method call, between the parentheses.
- Parameters in a method signature define variables that will serve as placeholders for arguments passed when the method is called.
- Method parameters can only be used within the method body.
- In method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name, as long as they have different method signatures.
- Method parameters can be optional if given a default using equals (=) syntax.
- When calling a method, arguments can be passed by position or by name. If using names, use the colon (:) syntax.
- Methods return values with the return keyword.
- We can define a type and value for a method to return.
- Every method has a return type, designated in its method signature. That type must match the type of the value actually returned.
- If a method returns no type, its return type is void.
- out parameters can be used to return multiple values from a method.
