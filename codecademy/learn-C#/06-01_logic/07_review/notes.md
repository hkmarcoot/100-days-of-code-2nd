Weâ€™ve learned about logic and Boolean values, including how to:

- Define variables with a bool data type
- Use the equality operators == and != to check whether values are the same or not
- Use the comparison operators <, <=, >, >= to compare values relative to each other
- Use logical operators ||, &&, and !, to combine or change Boolean values and expressions
