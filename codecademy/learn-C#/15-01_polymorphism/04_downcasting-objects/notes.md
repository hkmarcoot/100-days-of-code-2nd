## Downcasting Objects

Downcasting in C# refers to converting an upcast instance to a derived one. This process allows us to access the derived class members that are unavailable in the base class.

Downcasting can fail if the objects are not compatible, so it must be done carefully. Downcasting is an explicit operation and requires extra syntax:

```
BaseClass upcastInstance = new DerivedClass()
DerivedClass downcastInstance = (DerivedClass)upcastInstance;

```

In the above example, an upcast instance is created. To downcast, an explicit use of the derived class type is placed before the upcast instance. This gives the downcastInstance access to both the BaseClass and the DerivedClass methods.

Letâ€™s explore downcasting with an example:

```
class Animal {
  public void Walk() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal walks.");
  }

  public virtual void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal makes noise.");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal {
  public void Sleep() {
    Console.WriteLine("Dog sleeps.");
  }

  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
  }
}

class Program {
  static void Main(string[] args) {
    // Create an upcast Animal object
    Animal myAnimal = new Dog();

    // Downcast the myAnimal object
    Dog myDog = (Dog)myAnimal;

    myDog.MakeSound(); // Output: Dog barks.
    myDog.Walk(); // Output: Animal walks.
    myDog.Sleep(); // Output: Dog sleeps.
  }
}

```

A Dog object is created and upcast to the myAnimal variable of type Animal. The myAnimal reference is then downcast to a Dog reference and assigned to the myDog variable. myDog can now call the MakeSound(), Walk(), and Sleep() methods.
