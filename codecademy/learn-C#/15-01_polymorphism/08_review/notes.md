Polymorphism in C# is a powerful concept that allows objects of different types to be treated through a common interface or base class. This enables more flexible, maintainable, and reusable code. Let’s review the key concepts we’ve covered:

- Virtual methods in base classes can be overridden in derived classes to provide specific implementations.
- Upcasting is the implicit conversion of a derived class object to a base class reference.
- Downcasting is the explicit conversion of a base class reference to a derived class reference.
- The is operator checks if an object can cast to a specified type.
- The as operator attempts to cast an object to a specified type, returning null if the cast fails.
- Abstract classes provide a common base with both abstract and concrete methods, allowing for partial implementation.
