## Introduction to Polymorphism

Imagine a method that changes its behavior based on the object it works with. In object-oriented programming, Polymorphism allows methods with the same name to perform different actions depending on the object.

Consider an Animal class with subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird. Polymorphism lets you call the same method, such as MakeSound(), on any of these objects and get different results based on the subclass.

Without polymorphism, you’d need to check each Animal subclass type and call the appropriate method, leading to repetitive and cluttered code. Instead, polymorphism lets you call MakeSound(), automatically invoking the correct method based on the object’s type. This makes your code cleaner, more concise, and easier to maintain, allowing new animal types to be added without modifying existing code.

Polymorphism provides several benefits:

- Flexibility and Maintainability: You can add new classes with little or no modification to the existing code.
- Code Reusability: Common functionality can be written in the base class, and specific functionality can be implemented in derived classes.
- Simplified Code: Complex switch-case or if-else structures can be avoided, making the code cleaner and easier to read.
