## Review: Git and GitHub, Part I

Review what you just learned in the Git and Github, Part I Unit.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to the Git versioning technology. Understanding Git is a crucial tool in your developer toolkit—but don’t worry if it didn’t stick! Practice is crucial with Git, which is why we introduced it early in the Path. You also now know how to take the repositories on your computer and put them online with GitHub. Having your work on Github will be important when you apply for jobs, and now you also know how to write a solid README.md with markdown.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Version control projects using Git
- Backtrack in Git
- Host a codebase online using GitHub repositories
- Use markdown to author a good README.md file
