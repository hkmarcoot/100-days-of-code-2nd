You should have an understanding of grid structure, the components that make up a grid, and how to use them to properly space elements within your design.

Remember, the reasons we design using grids are:

- Promote consistency within our designs
- Properly align elements on our page
- Provide ample spacing between content

Remember a grid is made up of:

- Columns
- Gutters
- Margins

Spacing is incredibly important within a design to ensure:

- Elements have ample room to breathe
- Denote emphasis on certain parts of a page
- Promote harmonious patterns and rhythms within your designs

Following these guidelines will allow you to create elegant and usable sites!
