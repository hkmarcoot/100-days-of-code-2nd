## Introduction: Complex Data Structures

In this Unit, you will learn about complex data structures.

The goal of this unit is to continue interview preparation by introducing you to advanced applications of data structures. You will learn how to implement complex data structures, such as hash maps, trees and heaps, and when to use them based on the characteristics of your data. These topics are practical knowledge for all stages of a job interview.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Use hash maps to efficiently store and retrieve data
- Store hierarchical data using trees
- Implement min/max heaps
- Represent complex data using graphs
