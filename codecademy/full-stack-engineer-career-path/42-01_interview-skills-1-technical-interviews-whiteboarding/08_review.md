Review
Technical interviews judge the candidateâ€™s ability to perform technical aspects of the job. Whiteboarding is a type of technical interview which requires the candidate to code a solution without the assistance of a text editor.

Coding an efficient solution is important, but the ultimate goal as an interviewee is to convince the interviewer you would be a desirable co-worker.

A desirable co-worker is able to articulate their thought process and collaborate without friction.

Our whiteboarding strategies revolve around communication at every step.

The steps are:

Clarify the Problem
Create Inputs
Outline the Solution
Code the Solution
Test the Solution
Analyze the Solution
