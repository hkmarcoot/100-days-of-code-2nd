## Linked List Example

As an example, we added values to the linked list diagram from the introduction.

This linked list contains three nodes (node_a, node_b, and node_c).

Each node in this particular list contains a string as its data. As the sequence is defined, the order is "cats", "dogs", and "birds".

The list ends at node_c, since the link within that node is set to null.

What links would need to be established to add a new head node to this list? What about the tail?
