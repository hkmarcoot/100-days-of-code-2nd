Queues Review
Let’s take a minute to review what we’ve covered about queues in this lesson.

Queues:

Contain data nodes
Support three main operations:
Enqueue adds data to the back of the queue
Dequeue removes and provides data from the front of the queue
Peek provides data on the front of the queue
Can be implemented using a linked list or array
Bounded queues have a limited size.
Enqueueing onto a full queue causes a queue overflow
Queues process data First In, First Out (FIFO)
