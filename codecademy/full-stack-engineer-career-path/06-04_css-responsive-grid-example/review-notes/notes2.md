Letâ€™s review:

- grid-template-areas specifies grid named grid areas
- grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
- justify-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
- justify-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
- justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
- align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
- align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
- align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
- grid-auto-rows specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
- grid-auto-columns specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
- grid-auto-flow specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created
