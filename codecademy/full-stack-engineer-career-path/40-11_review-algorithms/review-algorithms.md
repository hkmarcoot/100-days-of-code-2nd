Review: Algorithms
In this Unit, you learned about different types of algorithms.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to recursion and sorting algorithms and how to measure the computing efficiency of an algorithm. These topics are practical knowledge for all stages of a job interview.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Identify and apply recursive algorithms
- Relate Big-O notation to algorithmic runtime
- Sort data using the bubble, merge, and quicksort algorithms
