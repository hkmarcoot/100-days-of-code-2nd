## DevOps Culture

An introduction to the culture of DevOps.

DevOps seeks to change the dynamic between many Operations and Development teams. It aims to enable trust, collaboration, problem resolution, and continuous improvement. The tools and practices of DevOps will produce little benefit without such a culture. In this article, we will discuss concepts DevOps teams use to enable this culture:

- Systems-level thinking
- Continuous learning and experimentation
- Feedback loops

Let’s begin by seeing how DevOps has us seek a bird’s-eye view of what is happening in our development process.

## Systems-Level Thinking

Within a traditional team, we often focus on our tasks rather than the big picture. Developers might concentrate on the code without considering infrastructure or testing needs. The Operations team might only consider infrastructure needs without considering impacts on functionality. DevOps seeks to have each member of the team consider the entire development process. All members share responsibility for the final result. Thinking about the whole process, or systems-level thinking, requires the involvement of many perspectives.

To achieve systems-level thinking, the DevOps culture creates teams comprised of people from many domains. A team might have several developers but also at least one Operations member. The goal is to have a diversified skill-set across the team. Development members will pick up aspects of Operations, and Operations members will gain knowledge of development work. These knowledge gains allow members to make better decisions at each development stage.

A bottleneck is a system’s slowest point, causing a slowdown in the entire process. When each team member is only looking at their small piece, the big picture is often made invisible. This makes identifying bottlenecks more challenging. A Development team with an expansive process view can resolve systemic issues and increase throughput for the entire process.

Resolving bottlenecks is a process of gradual improvement and setbacks. Let’s next discuss how DevOps seeks to always keep improving.

## Continuous Learning and Experimentation

DevOps seeks to include process improvement as a part of everyday work. Combining Development and Operations teams should expose a variety of inefficiencies. The team should identify ways to simplify and automate their production processes.

Though we intend to make improvements, making changes will result in new problems. These problems are an expected part of DevOps. Failure is an opportunity to learn rather than something to punish. One method DevOps uses to normalize failure is through blameless retrospectives (a.k.a. “post-mortems”). Teams hold retrospectives at the end of a sprint, project, or issue resolution. Here, team members discuss what went well as well as things to improve.

Members should base improvements on information coming from the system. DevOps requires information to flow throughout the development process. Let’s discuss the way DevOps creates these feedback loops.

## Feedback Loops

DevOps employs a variety of strategies to incorporate feedback into its processes on an ongoing basis. Let’s take a look at a few of these feedback loops.

- Metrics
  DevOps seeks to use metrics from each stage of the development process to improve and adapt. Operations members can help developers build monitoring into their application’s build processes and deployments. This information will better inform developers on code quality and reveal defects.

  Adding metrics to the software can be very helpful, but having too many can produce unwanted noise. We must focus on metrics that affect the customer. Some of these include:

Time to load a website page
Time to issue/outage resolution
Time to new feature release

- Shifting Left
  A defect, or problem, becomes more expensive to fix as it moves along the development process. A defect with someone’s idea is cheap to resolve. When that defect has made its way onto thousands of servers, fixing it is much more expensive. DevOps seeks to discover defects as early as possible, a strategy known as shifting left.

- Building Quality In
  Involving even more teams can lead to further improvement. Teams like Security and Accessibility can integrate with Development teams as well. Considering aspects like these throughout the development process is what DevOps refers to as “building quality in.“

Review
DevOps culture is centered around collaboration, systems-level thinking, and feedback loops. These pillars allow DevOps to continuously improve the speed and quality of production. Much of the discussion about integrating DevOps focuses on tools and practices, but establishing a well-formed DevOps culture is critical to its success.
