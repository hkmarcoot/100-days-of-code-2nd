The Benefits of DevOps
DevOps seeks to integrate Development and Operations, by having them work together. By integrating Development and Operations teams, we can have:

Consistent development, testing, and production environments
Fewer hand-offs and shared information and context
Management of infrastructure with development tools
With these outcomes, practicing DevOps achieves faster delivery of reliable software.

For DevOps to succeed, we need to change how Development and Operations interact. We need to create a culture in which collaboration can thrive.

DevOps Culture
The culture of DevOps is the most critical factor to its success. Collaboration cannot occur only from applying a set of practices and tools. It requires a culture in which collaboration can thrive. The central pillars of a DevOps culture include:

Thinking about the whole production system, rather than a single department or part.
Feedback loops allowing each part of the process to receive information and improve.
A culture of continuous experimentation and learning.
While these ideas are useful concepts, there needs to be a practical means of applying them. DevOps has a variety of practices that support its culture.

DevOps Practices
Some of the important practices that DevOps uses include:

Automation: making manual processes occur automatically instead.
Continuous Integration: the regular merging of contributor code into a central repository.
Continuous Deployment and Delivery: automatically preparing code changes for release.
Infrastructure as Code: representing aspects of infrastructure within source code files.
Microservices: dividing up a business application into many small independent services.
Monitoring: gathering information about the state of the system during runtime.
A variety of tools can be used to implement these practices.

DevOps Tools
We can organize DevOps tools into some general categories. Many options exist for each type (click on each item to learn more!):

Source Control Management

Source control management (SCM) tools help developers track and manage source code changes. Git is the most popular source control management tool. We offer a course on Git where you can gain hands-on experience!

Environment tools

Environment tools assist with the configuration of hardware and software for running code. Popular environment tools include Docker and Kubernetes.

Automation tools

Automation tools assist in performing routine tasks via scripts. Popular automation tools include Github Actions and Jenkins.

Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow us to define infrastructure as source files. IaC allows us to manage and track changes to our infrastructure over time. Popular IaC tools include Docker, Chef, and Terraform.

Testing

Testing tools ensure the correctness of our code. Popular testing tools include Mocha and Jest.
