## What are Modules?

Modules are reusable pieces of code in a file that can be exported and then imported for use in another file. A modular program is one whose components can be separated, used individually, and recombined to create a complex system.

By isolating code into separate files, called modules, you can:

- Find, fix, and debug code more easily.
- Reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of your application.
- Keep information private and protected from other modules.
- Prevent pollution of the global namespace and potential naming collisions, by cautiously selecting variables and behavior we load into a program.
