## Evaluate All Paths

Currently, weâ€™re evaluating the distances to the neighbors of the starting vertex, but we want to expand this to every connected vertex in the graph. Every time we discover a shorter path to a neighbor, we should queue up the neighbor to explore its connections and evaluate them.

This will accomplish two things:

- Any paths that have not yet been explored will be explored
- For vertices that already have a path found, we will re-evaluate if the alternate path through the neighbor will result in a shorter distance.

We are guaranteed that every vertex is evaluated because whenever a path is found to a vertex, then it will be queued up and its neighbors will be evaluated. The only way for a vertex to escape evaluation is if there are no connections to the vertex.

For our queue, we will use a priority queue. A priority queue is a specialized form of a min-heap, where the priority of a piece of data is stored alongside data, and elements are popped based on the priority value. We have provided the MinHeap.js file for you in case you want a refresher on a basic heap data structure. In the meantime, take a look through PriorityQueue.js to familiarize yourself with the data structure. We mainly need the .add() method to queue up elements with a priority, and the .popMin() method to grab the element with the lowest priority.

This priority queue is better than a regular queue since it allows us to evaluate the vertices with the shortest distances first. This way we can avoid unnecessarily re-evaluating paths later in the queue since it is less likely that a longer path will result in a shorter distance.
