## Introduction: Algorithms

In this Unit, you will be introduced to computer algorithms.

The goal of this unit is to continue interview preparation by introducing you to the fundamentals of algorithms. You will learn how to implement recursion and sorting algorithms and how to measure the computing efficiency of an algorithm. These topics are practical knowledge for all stages of a job interview.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Identify and apply recursive algorithms
- Relate Big-O notation to algorithmic run time
- Sort data using the bubble, merge, and quicksort algorithms
