What can we generalize so far?

COUNT()
: count the number of rows

SUM()
: the sum of the values in a column

MAX()
/
MIN()

AVG()
: the average of the values in a column

ROUND()
: round the values in the column

Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.

GROUP BY
is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.

HAVING
limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.

What is HAVING?
A conditional statement similar to WHERE but used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), AVG()).
