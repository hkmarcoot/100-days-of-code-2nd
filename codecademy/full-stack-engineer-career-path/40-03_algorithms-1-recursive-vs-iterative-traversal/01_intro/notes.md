## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to implement a recursive solution to a linked list search. The method accepts a value as input and recursively checks each node in the linked list, until the node of interest is found. If it is found, the method should return the node. Otherwise, it should return null.

Before you begin, letâ€™s take a look at how we can search for an element in a linked list using an iterative approach. The code below is taken from the LinkedList() class in LinkedList.js.

```
findNodeIteratively(data) {
  let currentNode = this.head;
  while (currentNode !== null) {
    if (currentNode.data === data) {
      return currentNode;
    }
    currentNode = currentNode.next;
  }
  return null;
}

```

The method starts at the head of the linked list and checks if the input data is equal to the data parameter at the head. The method continues to iterate through the linked list until the node is found or the end of the list is reached.
