In this lesson, you learned how to implement a recursive solution to a linked list search. The solution includes the following cases:

- Base case 1 – return the current node if it matches the data argument.
- Base case 2 – return null if the end of the linked list is reached.
- Recursive Case – return a call to .findNodeRecursively() with the next node as an argument.

The recursive approach laid out in this lesson is similar to implementations for traversing other data structures, like trees and directories. This is an important insight to keep in mind as you encounter more recursive implementations.
