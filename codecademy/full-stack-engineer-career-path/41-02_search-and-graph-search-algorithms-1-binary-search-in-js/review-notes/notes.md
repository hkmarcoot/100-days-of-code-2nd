In this lesson, you learned how to implement an iterative binary search solution. The function returns the index of the target value from a sorted list. If the target value is not found, the function returns null. You used the following steps to create this function:

- Initialize the left and right indices as 0 and the length of the array.
- Create a while loop that continues to execute until the left index equals the right index.
- Get the value at the index that falls in the middle of left and right.
- Return the index if the value is equal to target.
- Set left equal to the current index plus one if the target is greater than the value.
- Set right equal to the current index if the target is less than the value.

While the benefits of binary search are significant compared to linear search, itâ€™s important to remember that the function will only work on sorted lists.
