Review: Search and Graph Search Algorithms
In this Unit, you learned about search algorithms.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to binary search and graph search algorithms. You learned how binary search trees organize data so searching can be done quickly and how different graph search algorithms can greatly affect the efficiency of the search. These topics are practical knowledge for all stages of a job interview.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Describe the benefits of the binary search algorithm
- Implement a binary search tree
- Explain the depth-first graph search algorithm
- Explain the breadth-first graph search algorithm
- Summarize Dijkstraâ€™s graph traversal algorithm
