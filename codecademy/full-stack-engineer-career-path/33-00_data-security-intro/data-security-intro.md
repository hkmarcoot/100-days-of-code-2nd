## Introduction: Data Security

See what you’ll be learning in the Data Security Unit.

Web applications are constantly under threat. From malicious threat actors to curious teenagers, malicious code or hacking attempts are coming from every angle. Using the OWASP Top 10’s list of the most critical security risks to web applications as a guide, you can protect your users, and yourself, from threats to your Node.js applications. The goal of this Unit is to explore Transport Layer Security (TLS), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Authentication & Authorization in Postgres, and managing sensitive data in Node.js.

After this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Explain TLS and SSL and certificates
- Design a Role-Based Access Control System
- Improve Authentication & Authorization when using a Postgres database
- Manage and secure environment variables, API keys, and files in Node.js
