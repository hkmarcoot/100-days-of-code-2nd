## Introduction: JavaScript Testing

See what’s covered in the JavaScript Testing Unit.

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to the fundamentals of JavaScript testing and different testing methodologies. You’ll use Test Driven Development (TDD) as an example of how testing can influence software development. You will learn about different types of tests and how using tests will catch and identify issues with your code before you deploy it to users.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- State the benefits of testing
- Identify different types of testing and methodologies
- Write tests using Mocha and Chai
- Apply TDD techniques to software development
- Describe how code coverage is used as a metric for testing
- Incorporate mocking and spies into tests
