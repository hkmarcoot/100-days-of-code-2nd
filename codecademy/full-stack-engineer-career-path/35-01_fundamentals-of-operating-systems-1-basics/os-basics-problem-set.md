Within computing, what are input and output? What is the purpose of each?

- Input is how people physically interact with computers. By interacting with physical sensors, binary data is created and sent to the CPU for the event to be processed. Output is data processed and sent out by the CPU to interact physically with the user through devices such as monitors, speakers, and printers.

What is the purpose of the CPU within a computer?

- The CPU controls all the different components between hardware and software by processing all of the information that flows throughout the computer.

Both primary and secondary memory attempt to store data for later use by the CPU. Describe one benefit and one drawback for both primary memory and secondary memory.

- Primary memory is much faster and is used only for temporary, short-term storage, so the data is lost when it is no longer needed or the computer loses power. Secondary memory is slower, but can be used to permanently store data such as photos or text documents.

CPUs generally consist of three main components: a control unit (CU), an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), and a collection of registers. Compare the main functions of each of these three components.

- The control unit (CU) is the overseer of the CPU, responsible for controlling and monitoring the input and output of data from the computerâ€™s hardware. Its primary job is making sure that data is sent to the right component at the right time, and arrives with integrity.

- The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is where all of the processing of the computer takes place. It is the fundamental part of the CPU that actually does the arithmetic calculations of the data as well as the handling of logical comparisons and conditionals.

- The register, or immediate access store, is a limited space, high-speed memory mounted on the CPU for quick processing. It provides the CPU with a place to store values that are crucial for the calculations the ALU is currently processing.

What is the kernel within an operating system?

- The kernel manages all of the interactions between the hardware and software components of a computer, such as interfacing with memory and hard drives.

What are the main responsibilities of the operating system?

- The operating system is responsible for tasks such as process management, memory management, file system management, IO management, networking, security, and providing a user interface.
