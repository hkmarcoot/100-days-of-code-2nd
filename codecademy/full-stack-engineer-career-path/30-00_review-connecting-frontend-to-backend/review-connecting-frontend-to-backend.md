## Review: Connecting Front-End to Back-End

Connecting Front-End to Back-End
Review
Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to learn how to combine your front-end and back-end systems to create a cohesive full-stack application. As youâ€™ve seen, there are a few different ways to do this so you now you know about the tradeoffs of each approach as they relate to implementation and performance.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Relate how the front-end and back-end work together
- Describe code generation
- Create RESTful endpoints
- Compare the advantages and disadvantages of client-side vs. server-side rendering
- Make API calls from the server
- Use the MVC pattern to structure your apps
