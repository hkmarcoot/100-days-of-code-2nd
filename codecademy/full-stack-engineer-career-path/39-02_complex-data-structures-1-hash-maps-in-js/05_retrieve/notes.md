## Retrieve

To be a fully functional hash map, we have to be able to retrieve the values we are storing. To implement retrieval for our hash map we’ll create a new HashMap method, .retrieve().

This method will make use of .hash()‘s deterministic nature to find the value we’re looking for in the hash map.
