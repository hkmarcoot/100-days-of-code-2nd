MinHeap Class
Our MinHeap class will store two pieces of information:

- An array of elements within the heap.
- A count of the elements within the heap.

To make our lives easier, weâ€™ll always keep one element at the beginning of the array with the value null. By doing this, we can simplify our coding by always referencing our minimum element at index 1 instead of 0 and our last element at index this.size instead of this.size - 1.

```
const minHeap = new MinHeap();
console.log(minHeap.heap);
// [ null ]
console.log(minHeap.size);
// 0
```
