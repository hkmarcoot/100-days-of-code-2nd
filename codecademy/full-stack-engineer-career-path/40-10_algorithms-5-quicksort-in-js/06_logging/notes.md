## Logging

Letâ€™s put our implementation of the quicksort algorithm into practice. In order to understand what is going on internally inside each call to quicksort() and partition(), we have inserted log statements at various steps to illustrate the following events:

- a recursive call is about to occur
- partitioning is taking place
- leftIndex and rightIndex are incremented
- swapping has taken place
