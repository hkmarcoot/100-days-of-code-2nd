## Review: Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests

In this Unit, you learned about asynchronous JavaScript and how to use it to make HTTP requests to APIs.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to understand APIs and introduce asynchronous JavaScript and the concepts behind HTTP requests.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Write asynchronous JavaScript with async-await and promises syntax
- Explain the different types of HTTP requests
- Describe REST protocol
- Work with JSON data
- Make HTTP requests to external web APIs
