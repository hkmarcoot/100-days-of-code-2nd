## Graph Review

Letâ€™s put our Graph class to use and build out our train network. This time we will use it to map out all the train stations and routes that our rail service operates. We will also want to make sure that our routes can track the distance between each station.

For this exercise, we will build out the train network inside trainNetwork.js.
