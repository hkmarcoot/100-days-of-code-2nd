## Directed Graphs

So far we have only built out support for undirected graphs
. Next, we will focus on expanding our Graph class to be directed, where there does not necessarily have to be edges going in both directions between the vertices, as we have done with undirected graphs.

The main difference between the undirected graph and directed graph is that our undirected graph uses two edges going in opposite directions to indicate that there is a connection between two vertices.
