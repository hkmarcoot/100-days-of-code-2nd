## Review: Git and GitHub, Part II

You’ve learned how to perform more git and GitHub actions in this Unit.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to understand how you can use Git and GitHub for collaboration. That includes how to pair on a project with another learner, work together with a team at work, or contribute to an open-source project. You learned about essential skills like forking, dealing with merge conflicts, making pull requests (PRs), and managing projects.

After this unit, you are now able to:

- fork a repository
- create a pull request for an open-source project
- use GitHub project boards to track tasks
- leverage GitHub actions for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
