## Review: Designing Relational Databases

Review what you just learned in the Designing Relational Databases Unit.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to learn how to design relational databases that you can then implement in PostgreSQL. These skills and best practices are key to creating organized, scalable databases.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Use techniques for designing relational databases
- Read and design Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- Imagine data needs of famous sites - how might their databases be designed
