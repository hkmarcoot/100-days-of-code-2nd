## Review: Queues in JavaScript

Great work! You have just implemented a queue data structure in JavaScript by creating a Queue class that:

- follows FIFO protocol with .enqueue() and .dequeue() methods

- gives you the option of creating bounded queues with a .maxSize property

- prevents queue overflow and underflow by keeping track of the queue size
