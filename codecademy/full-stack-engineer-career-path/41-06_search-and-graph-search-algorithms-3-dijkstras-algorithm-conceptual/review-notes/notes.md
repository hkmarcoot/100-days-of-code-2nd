Dijkstras Algorithm Review

Congratulations on grasping a conceptual understanding of Dijkstra’s Algorithm!

Here’s a quick recap of what you’ve learned:

- Dijkstra’s algorithm is an algorithm to find all of the shortest distances between a start vertex and the rest of the vertices in a graph.
- The algorithm works by keeping track of all the distances and updating the distances as it conducts a breadth-first search.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm runs in O((E+V)log V).
