In this lesson we covered the concept of using breadcrumbs as a secondary navigation method for a site:

- Use breadcrumbs to indicate where a user is and the extent of the site
- Breadcrumbs are implemented using unordered lists in HTML with custom CSS styling
- Three types of breadcrumbs exist:
  - location - based on hierarchical structure of site
  - attribute - based on attributes of current page or item
  - path - unique to a userâ€™s journey on the site
- Path-based breadcrumbs can be confusing, only use if needed
- Ensure breadcrumbs will add value before adding to a site
