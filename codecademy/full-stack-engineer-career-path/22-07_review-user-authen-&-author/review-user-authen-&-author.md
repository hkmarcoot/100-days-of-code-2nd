## Review: User Authentication and Authorization

Review what you just learned in the User Authentication and Authorization Unit.

The goal of this unit was to learn how to implement user authentication and authorization in an express application. Authentication and authorization are key pieces to securing any web application that works with user data. In fact, they’re so important that Broken Authentication and Broken Access Control make up two of the OWASP Top Ten’s most critical security risks to web applications. Verifying who your users are and what they’re allowed to do will help create a safe and secure user experience.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Define Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption
- Explain the purpose of user sessions
- Implement Sessions in Express using express-session
- Allow users to log into an Express app using passport-local
- Secure user passwords with hashing and salts using bcrypt.js
- Add OAuth 2.0 as a login option to an Express app using oauth2-server
