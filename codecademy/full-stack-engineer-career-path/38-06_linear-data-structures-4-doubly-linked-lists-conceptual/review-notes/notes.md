## Doubly Linked Lists Review

Let’s take a minute to review what we’ve covered about doubly linked lists in this lesson. Doubly Linked Lists:

- Are comprised of nodes that contain links to the next and previous nodes
- Are bidirectional, meaning it can be traversed in both directions
- Have a pointer to a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
- Have a pointer to a single tail node, which serves as the last node in the list
- Require the pointers at the head of the list to be updated after addition to or removal of the head
- Require the pointers at the tail of the list to be updated after addition to or removed of the tail
- Require the pointers of the surrounding nodes to be updated after removal from the middle of the list

Your browser history is another example of a doubly linked list. When you open your browser, the page that you land on is the head of your list. As you click on things and navigate to new pages, you are moving forward and adding to the tail of your list. If you ever want to go back to something you’ve already visited, you can use the “back” button to move backward through your list. Can you think of another computer use case for a doubly linked list?
