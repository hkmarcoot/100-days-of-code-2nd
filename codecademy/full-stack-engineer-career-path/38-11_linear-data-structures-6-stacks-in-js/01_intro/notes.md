## Introduction

You have an understanding of how stacks work in theory, so now let’s see how they can be useful out in the wild — with Javascript!

Remember that there are three main methods that we want our stacks to have:

- Push - adds data to the top of the stack
- Pop - provides and removes data from the top of the stack
- Peek - provides data from the top of the stack without removing it

We also need to consider the stack’s size and tweak our methods a bit so that our stack does not overflow.

Let’s get started building out our Stack class.
