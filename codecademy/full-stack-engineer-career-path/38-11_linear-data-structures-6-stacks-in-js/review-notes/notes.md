Nice work — you’ve built out a Stack class that can:

- add a new item to the top via a .push() method
- remove an item from the top and returns its value with a .pop() method
- return the value of the top item using a .peek() method
- allow a stack instance to maintain an awareness of its size to prevent stack overflow.
