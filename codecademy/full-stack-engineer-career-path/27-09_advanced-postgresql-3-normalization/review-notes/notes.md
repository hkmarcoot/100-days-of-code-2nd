Letâ€™s review what you have learned!

- Repeating groups of columns and columns that are not dependent on the primary key of a table can cause problems related to:
  - Duplicated data
  - Data modification (updates/insertions)
  - Querying
- Database normalization is a process by which database tables are modified/restructured to address these problems
- Database design can be modified after data has been entered, but it is usually easiest to design a normalized schema up front
- It is important to keep database use in mind when designing an optimal database schema
