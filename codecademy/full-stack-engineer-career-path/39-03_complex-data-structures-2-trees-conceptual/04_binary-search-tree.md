## Binary Search Tree

Constraints are placed on the data or node arrangement of a tree to solve difficult problems like efficient search.

A binary tree is a type of tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and right child.

Further constraints make a binary search tree:

- Left child values must be lesser than their parent.
- Right child values must be greater than their parent.

The constraints of a binary search tree allow us to search the tree efficiently. At each node, we can discard half of the remaining possible values!

Letâ€™s walk through locating the value 31.

Start at the root: 39
31 < 39, we move to the left child: 23
23 < 31, we move to the right child: 35
31 < 35, we move to the left child: 31
We found the value 31!
In a dataset of fifteen elements, we only made three comparisons. What a deal!
