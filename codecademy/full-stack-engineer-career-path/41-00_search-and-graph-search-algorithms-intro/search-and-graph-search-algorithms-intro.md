## Introduction: Search and Graph Search Algorithms

In this Unit, you will be introduced to search algorithms.

The goal of this unit is to continue interview preparation by introducing you to the fundamentals of search algorithms. You will learn how to apply search algorithms to efficiently search through tree and graph data structures. These topics are practical knowledge for all stages of a job interview.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Describe the benefits of the binary search algorithm
- Implement a binary search tree
- Explain the depth-first graph search algorithm
- Explain the breadth-first graph search algorithm
- Summarize Dijkstraâ€™s graph traversal algorithm
