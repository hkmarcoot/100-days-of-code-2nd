## Review: Data Security

Review what you just learned in the Data Security Unit.

Congratulations! Using the OWASP Top 10â€™s list of the most critical security risks to web applications as a guide, you can protect your users, and yourself, from threats to your Node.js and Express applications. The goal of this unit was to focus on Transport Layer Security (TLS), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Authentication & Authorization in Postgres, and managing sensitive data in Node.js.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Explain TLS and SSL and certificates
- Design a Role-Based Access Control System
- Improve Authentication & Authorization when using a Postgres database
- Manage and secure environment variables, API keys, and files in Node.js
