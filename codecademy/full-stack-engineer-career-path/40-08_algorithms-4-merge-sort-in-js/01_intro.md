## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to implement the merge sort algorithm in JavaScript. The algorithm consists of two distinct steps:

- Splitting the input array – The algorithm recursively splits the input array until each element is in its own array. This portion of the algorithm is represented in the top half of the image to the right.

- Merging sorted arrays – The algorithm compares and combines the elements of arrays until the input array is sorted. This is shown in the bottom half of the image.
  We’ll start in the next exercise by recursively splitting the input array.
