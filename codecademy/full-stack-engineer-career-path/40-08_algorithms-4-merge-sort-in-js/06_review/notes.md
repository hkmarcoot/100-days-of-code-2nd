Nice work building your own mergeSort() function. An important point to remember about merge sort is that the algorithm is broken into two parts: splitting and merging.

Regardless of the order or length (including odd or even lengths) of an input array, the merge sort algorithm will always split the elements into their own arrays first, and then combine them into a sorted array. The fact that the same steps are taken regardless of the input (order and length) results in an average, best, and worst case complexity all equal to the same value, O(n log n).

This time complexity makes merge sort one of the most efficient and popular sorting algorithms. Take a look at merge sort compared to a few others on toptal.com.
