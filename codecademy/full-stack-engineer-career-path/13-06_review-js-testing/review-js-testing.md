In this Unit, you learned about JavaScript testing.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to the fundamentals of JavaScript testing and different testing methodologies. You’ll use Test Driven Development (TDD) as an example of how testing can influence software development.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- State the benefits of testing
- Identify different types of testing and methodologies
- Write tests using Mocha and Chai
- Apply TDD techniques to software development
