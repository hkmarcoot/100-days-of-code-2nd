## Remove By Data I

In addition to removing the head and the tail of the list, it would also be useful to remove a specific element that could be anywhere in the list. Imagine that you have a list of errands to run. You donâ€™t always do your errands in order, so when you finish doing your laundry, that could be somewhere in the middle of the list. We are going to build a .removeByData() method that will allow you to cross off (remove) that errand no matter where it is in the list.

In order to do this:

- Iterate through the list to find the matching node
- If there is no matching element in the list:
- Return null
- If there is a matching node, we will then check to see if it is the head or tail of the list:
- If so, call the corresponding .removeHead() or .removeTail() method
- If not, that means the node was somewhere in the middle of the list. In that case:
- Remove it by resetting the pointers of its previous and next nodes
- Finally, return the node
