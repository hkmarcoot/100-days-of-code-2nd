Using the Doubly Linked List
You finished your DoublyLinkedList class! Now we’re going to use that class to model a subway line. A doubly linked list is a great data structure to use to model a subway line, as both have a first and last element, and are comprised of nodes (or stops) with links to the elements before and after them.

We will add to and remove stops from our subway line, and print it out to see what we’ve done. The .printList() method is the same as the one from the LinkedList class and has been provided.
