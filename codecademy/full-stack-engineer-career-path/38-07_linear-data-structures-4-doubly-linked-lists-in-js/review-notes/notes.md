## Doubly Linked List Review

Congratulations, you have created and implemented a doubly linked list class in JavaScript!

We did this by:

- Using our Node class to hold the data and links between nodes
- Implementing a DoublyLinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes
- Creating an instance of our list, and using the .printList() method to track the changes we made
