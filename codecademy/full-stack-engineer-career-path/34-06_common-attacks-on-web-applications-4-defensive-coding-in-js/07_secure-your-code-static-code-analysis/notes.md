## Secure Your Code: Static Code Analysis

Static Code Analysis evaluates a code without executing it. A lint, or linter, is a static code analysis tool used to improve source code by finding and flagging programming errors, bugs, and patterns that may compromise security. Some of the most popular JavaScript linters are:

ESLint
JSLint
JSHint

We can customize the linter rules to fit our needs using configuration files or third-party plugins. eslint-plugin-security is a plugin that adds rules to detect several security vulnerabilities including all of the aforementioned security risks in this lesson.

Linter configuration and usage are beyond the scope of this introductory lesson, but we can see some of their power in the following instructions.
