Let’s take a minute to review what we’ve covered about nodes in this lesson.

Nodes:

- Contain data, which can be a variety of data types
- Contain links to other nodes. If a node has no links, or they are all null, you have reached the end of the path you were following.
- Can be orphaned if there are no existing links to them
