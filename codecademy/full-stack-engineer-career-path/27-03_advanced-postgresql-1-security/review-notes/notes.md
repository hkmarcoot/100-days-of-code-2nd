In this section, we’ve covered quite a few concepts related to database security.

Superuser permissions — You learned what a superuser was, what privileges they have, and when to use a superuser role.

Group and login roles — You learned about how login and group roles can be used to manage sets of users.

PostgreSQL internal permissions tables — You learned about the tables you can reference to monitor the privileges of the users in your database. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to safely delegate the correct permissions to other users in the database.

Schema and table level security — You learned about schema and table level security and how enabling default privileges can simplify the permission granting process.

Row and column level security — You learned about using these tools to have finer control over which data within a table a user can access.
