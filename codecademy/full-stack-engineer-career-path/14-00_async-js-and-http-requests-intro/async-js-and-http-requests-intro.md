## Introduction: Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests

In this Unit, youâ€™ll learn about asynchronous JavaScript and how to use it in web development.

The goal of this unit is to learn about working with asynchronous JavaScript. This will allow you to eventually make HTTP requests to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Working with APIs will enable you to work with data stored on remote servers, including data from third-party sites (such as Instagram and Reddit).

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Write asynchronous JavaScript with async-await and promises syntax
- Explain the different types of HTTP requests
- Describe REST protocol
- Work with JSON data
- Make HTTP requests to external web APIs
