## Compare

We have a loop to run our algorithm, and another that visits each element in the input array but if we were to run this as is, it would only iterate through the array once.

Let’s add some additional logic to our code in the bubbleSort.js file that will compare neighboring elements and swap them if necessary. For this exercise, you’ll only be adding code inside of the for loop of bubbleSort().
