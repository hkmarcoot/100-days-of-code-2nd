Review
In this lesson, you have successfully built a binary tree data structure in JavaScript. You have implemented:

- a BinaryTree class containing value, left and right child nodes and a depth
- an .insert() method to add and place a value at the correct location in the binary tree
- a .getNodeByValue() method to retrieve a child node by its value or null
- a .depthFirstTraversal() method to traverse the binary tree using the inorder traversal option

Congratulations!
