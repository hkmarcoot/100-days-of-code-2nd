## Introduction: Common Attacks on Web Applications

See what you’ll be learning in the Common Attacks on Web Applications Unit.

Web applications are constantly under threat. From malicious threat actors to curious teenagers, malicious code or hacking attempts are coming from every angle. Using the OWASP Top 10’s list of the most critical security risks to web applications as a guide, you can protect your users, and yourself, from threats to your Node.js applications. This content will specifically focus on SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks as well as insecure JavaScript coding practices.

After this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection Attacks
- Avoid unsafe JavaScript coding practices
- Explain the basics of Remediation and Incident Response
