Congratulations on completing the lesson and learning more about filesystems! Letâ€™s go over what we covered:

Filesystems are the data structure used by operating systems to store and retrieve data. Therefore they are crucial for the daily operations of a computer and learning about them.

The building blocks of the filesystem are the files themselves. A file is a unit of storage used to describe a self-contained piece of data.

Files can have a variety of formats depending on the type of data that they store, as indicated by the file extension following their name.

Files have permissions that determine which users and groups can read, write, and execute that file.

Directories are the data structure that contains references to files as well as other directories. Both files and directories can be created, opened, written, listed, and deleted using a wide variety of commands.

The file system itself is organized in a collection of abstract layers. These layers include the applications, logical file system, file-organization module, basic file system, IO control, and the storage devices themselves.
