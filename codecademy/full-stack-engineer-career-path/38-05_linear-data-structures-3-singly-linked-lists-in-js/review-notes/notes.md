Linked List Review
Congratulations, you have created and implemented a linked list class in JavaScript!

We did this by:

- Using our Node class to hold the data and links between nodes
- Implementing a LinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes
- Creating an instance of our list, and using our .printList() method to track the changes we made
