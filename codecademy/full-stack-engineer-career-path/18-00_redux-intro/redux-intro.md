## Introduction: Redux

In this unit, you will be introduced to Redux.

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to the Redux library. Redux is most commonly used with React to manage application state, but can also be used with other libraries and frameworks, such as Angular. Redux is good for when your application becomes very large and has lots of moving parts. You may not always need Redux in an application, but it is helpful to learn and a good thing to have on your resume.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Use the Redux library
- Understand why and when to use Redux in a React app
- Know how to use Redux as middleware logic
