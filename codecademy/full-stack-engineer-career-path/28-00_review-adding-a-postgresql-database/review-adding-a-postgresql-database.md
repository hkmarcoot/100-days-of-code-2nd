## Review: Adding a PostgreSQL Database

In this Unit, you learned how to add a PostgreSQL database to an app.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to learn how to integrate a PostgreSQL database into your full-stack application. You are now one step closer to creating a completely functional full-stack application.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Add a PostgreSQL database that your web app can access
- Write queries in your web app to pull data and populate pages
- Weigh the trade-offs between ORMs, query builders, and SQL

If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:
